* Talk to your website visitors and customers in real-time, right from Slack.
* Integrates seamlessly with HubSpot, Marketo, Mailchimp, Intercom, Salesforce, Segment and 100s more.
* If a `$current_user` is present, we use their email as an identifier in the widget.
Otherwise the widget operates in [aquisition mode](https://www.drift.com/live-chat) and prompts anonymous users for their email address. This allows you to talk with anonymous visitors on your WordPress site.
