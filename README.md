# Drift WordPress Integration

# Installation

3. Visit https://app.drift.com/customize and copy the code chunk
4. Visit Drift Settings on your WordPress site and paste the code chunk into the textarea. Submit the settings form.

# Users

If a `$current_user` is present, we use their email as an identifier in the widget.
Otherwise the widget operates in [anonymous mode](https://www.drift.com/live-chat) and you can require that a user submit their email address. This allows you to talk with anonymous visitors on your WordPress site.
